buildroot to make qemu image
cd to buildroot
make qemu_arm_versatile_defconfig
make nconfig to set options like ssh
make
run script in output/images/shellScript.sh, modify this as needed

add user, test ssh, copy file over, cross compile, then scp over
adduser -h /<username> -s /bin/sh <username>
ssh -p 2222 <username>@localhost

final project notes

read temperature from /var/log/heater, float in degrees C
turn heat on/off based on program and current temperature
write out timestamp and status to /var/log/heater
write single line <action> : <timestamp> example <on> : <posix_time>

start daemon service that can also run from command line
process configuration file, -c and --confic_file flags
provide help option, -h and --help

config file will configure:
https endpoint
log file path
any other configs

accept programs via http interface
program up to three different temperatures per day at arbitrary time

report status to an outside process via http
report actions to an outside process via http

attack surfaces:
protect your code!
protect your image!
config files
function arguments
network traffic
music files
documnt on paper!

Extra Credit: 
support more extensive programming
unit tests
